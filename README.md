# webgpu-ocean
A real-time 3d fluid simulation implemented in WebGPU. Works on your browsers which support WebGPU.

The following are the characteristics of the simulation.
- The simulation is based on **Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)** described in [Particle-Based Fluid Simulation for Interactive Applications](https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/publications/sca03.pdf) by MÃ¼ller et al.
  - Compute shader is used for implementing SPH. 
- **Screen-Space Rendering** described in [GDC 2010 slide](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/presentations/2010/gdc/Direct3D_Effects.pdf) is used for rendering the fluid.
  - Vertex/fragment shader is used for implementing Screen-Space Rendering.
- For **fast neighborhood search** on GPU, an algorithm described in [FAST FIXED-RADIUS NEAREST NEIGHBORS: INTERACTIVE MILLION-PARTICLE FLUIDS](https://ramakarl.com/pdfs/2014_Hoetzlein_FastFixedRadius_Neighbors.pdf) is used. 

## 100,000 particles mode
To reduce the load on the browser, the maximum number of particles in the simulation is limited to 40,000 by default. But with a decent GPU, it's possible to simulate ~100,000 particles in real-time. To enable simulating 100,000 particles, make 5th button visible by editing the html using developer tool. 

Below is the simulation of 100,000 particles. The simulation is run on a laptop with RTX 3060 Mobile.
